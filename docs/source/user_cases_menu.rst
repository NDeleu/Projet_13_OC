User guide and user cases
==========================

   In this segment we will detail the functions when used in tests.

   We will use tests to simulate use cases. If you run all tests, you can run the command: ``pytest`` .
   If you want to get the test coverage, you can enter the command: ``pytest --cov=.``.
