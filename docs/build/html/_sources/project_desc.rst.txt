Project description
====================

`Python-OC-Lettings-FR` was created to meet the needs of the start-up Orange Country Lettings.
This application aims to identify and track customers and
rentals through a system of rental tickets and rental properties.

The company being in full growth, decided to improve its site (access on this application).
For this, the application has been modified to move from a monolithic structure to a modular structure.
In addition, in the desire to offer this site to the general public, a CI/CD pipeline has been set up on Gitlab
in order to frame the containerization and deployment of the application on AWS.
